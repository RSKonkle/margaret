                <p class="hero-welcome">
                    I am a program builder, strategist, and fund development leader with experience
                    spanning across the nonprofit advocacy space to economic and community based
                    development and systems change.
                </p>
                <p class="hero-welcome">
                    My career sits at the intersection of advocacy, economic development, and
                    community based problem-solving. This is demonstrated through my work with 
                    projects related to housing, legal access, rural equity, business and industrial
                    development, and property management.
                </p>
                <p class="hero-welcome">
                    Across roles with Equality Michigan, Albion Economic Development Corporation,
                    and Battle Creek Habitat for Humanity, I have led the creation of new programs
                    and coalitions, secured millions in public and philanthropic funding, and
                    coordinated cross-sector partners at the local, regional, and state levels. I am
                    drawn to early-stage and foundation-setting work that requires vision, persistence,
                    and strategic problem-solving to move from aspiration and implementation.
